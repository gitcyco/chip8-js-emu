Memory: 4096 bytes (12 bit addressing)
  0x0000 -> 0x1000
  0x0000 -> 0x01FF (legacy reserved 512 bytes)
    This can be used to store fonts, sprites, etc.

Registers:
  16x 8-bit data registers:
    V0-VE -> general purpose registers
    VF    -> carry flag register
    PC    -> program counter, points to current instruction
    I     -> Index register, points to memory locations


Stack:
  48 byte stack at top of memory
    Size is legacy, can be larger
    Each entry is 16 bits (2 bytes) for 12-bit addressing

Timers: 8-bit 60hz count down to 0
  DT: Delay timer
  ST: Sound timer (play sound when non-zero)

Input: hex input
  16 keys: 0 -> F

Display: Monochrome
  64x32 pixels for legacy
    Can be configurable

Sprites:
  8-bit wide, 1->15 pixels height (1 -> 15 bytes)
  each bit is either 0 (transparent) or 1 (flip state)

Sound: (on/off only)
  ST timer is used, play tone when non-zero


INSTRUCTION SET:

Instructions are 2 bytes, 16-bits

  Each instruction is divided into 4 nibbles, or 4x 4-bit values.

  AXYN is A.X.Y.N.
  AXNN
  ANNN
  A is the instruction
  XYN -> are variable

    X: The second nibble. Used to look up one of the 16 registers (VX) from V0 through VF.
    Y: The third nibble. Also used to look up one of the 16 registers (VY) from V0 through VF.
    N: The fourth nibble. A 4-bit number.
    NN: The second byte (third and fourth nibbles). An 8-bit immediate number.
    NNN: The second, third and fourth nibbles. A 12-bit immediate memory address.
